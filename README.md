**Yolo Vehicle Counter**

YoLo is a CNN architecture which specialize in object detection. I am using tutorial from https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/11/12/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv/ to develop my own modification. This project aims to count every vehicle(motorcycle, bus, car, cycle, truck)  detected in the input image/video.
